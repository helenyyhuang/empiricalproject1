# Empirical Project 1 - Stories from the Atlas: Describing Data using Maps, Regressions, and Correlations
This repository contains my work on Empirical Project 1 from Prof. Raj Chetty's Big Data course, which is publicly accessible at [Opportunity Insights Course website](https://opportunityinsights.org/course/). The project focuses on assessing economic mobility within Baltimore.

## Technological Tools
- STATA

## Engaging with the Project
1. Download the repository by clicking the 'Code' button and selecting 'Download ZIP' at the top right corner.
2. Extract the ZIP file on your computer.
3. Rename the folder after extracting it to ensure it is named `project1`.
4. Install Stata (if not already installed) to run the .do files.
5. Alternatively, view the `do.` and `.dta` files directly in the repository, or refer to the `empiricalproject1_helen.pdf` for a static representation of the responses and analysis.
6. For any queries or assistance, feel free to contact me at yhuan199@alumni.jh.edu.
